The outcome will be a repeatable methodology, supporting tools, and documentation that enable proactive forecasting of resource needs, alignment with business demand, and cost‑effective scaling.\\n\\n## Scope\\n- Identify all production workloads (applications, databases, middleware, network, storage) that require capacity management.\\n- Define capacity metrics, thresholds, and reporting cadence for each workload.\\n- Build a capacity planning model (capacity baseline, growth projections, scenario analysis).\\n- Implement tooling (e.g., monitoring dashboards, forecasting scripts, capacity repository).\\n- Produce a Capacity Planning Playbook and training materials for operations teams.\\n- Exclude non‑production environments (dev/test) unless they are explicitly tied to production scaling.\\n\\n## Requirements\\n- **Data Collection**: Integrate with existing monitoring platforms (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk) to pull historical utilization data for CPU, memory, storage, network I/O, and licensing.\\n- **Baseline Establishment**: Establish a 12‑month utilization baseline for each critical service.\\n- **Forecasting Engine**: Develop a forecasting model using statistical methods (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing) or machine‑learning where appropriate.\\n- **Scenario Modeling**: Ability to model “what‑if” scenarios such as traffic spikes, new feature roll‑outs, and seasonal demand.\\n- **Alerting**: Configure alerts when projected utilization exceeds defined thresholds (e.g., 80% of capacity) within a 3‑month horizon.\\n- **Reporting**: Monthly capacity report template and a self‑service dashboard for stakeholders.\\n- **Documentation**: Comprehensive playbook covering process steps, roles & responsibilities, and escalation paths.\\n- **Compliance**: Ensure all data handling"
