    """Intelligent query processor that understands natural language and handles any permutation of PMS queries.

    USE THIS TOOL WHEN:
    - No other specific tool matches the query exactly
    - User asks complex questions spanning multiple collections
    - Questions involve relationships between projects, work items, cycles, members, etc.
    - Need dynamic query generation based on relationship registry
    - Questions involve filtering, aggregation, or complex relationships
    - AS A LAST RESORT when specific tools like count_work_items_by_module don't apply

    This is the SMART FALLBACK tool that replaces the need for hundreds of specific tools by:
    ✅ Understanding natural language queries
    ✅ Using relationship registry to build optimal MongoDB pipelines
    ✅ Handling any combination of entities and relationships
    ✅ Applying security constraints automatically
    ✅ Generating appropriate aggregations and projections

    Args:
        query: Natural language query (e.g., "Show me high priority tasks in the API project", "How many work items are in upcoming cycles?", "List all projects with their team members")

    Returns intelligently processed query results based on the relationship registry.

    Examples:
    - "Show me work items for upcoming cycles"
    - "How many high priority tasks are in the mobile project?"
    - "List projects with their active cycles and work items"
    - "Find members working on completed tasks"
    - "Get project overview with cycle and task counts"
